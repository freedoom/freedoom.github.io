= What is Freedoom?
// See COPYING.adoc for license terms of this file.

== A free FPS action game

In 1999 https://www.idsoftware.com/[id Software] released the source code to their
classic game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)[_Doom_]
(under the https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GNU General
Public License]). This means that the _program code_ that powers _Doom_ is free,
but the actual _content_ of _Doom_ - graphics, audio, levels, setting and characters -
remains proprietary. The Freedoom project aims to fill this gap and create a complete
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free and libre] first person shooter game.

By itself, _Freedoom_ is just the content of a game and must be paired with a
https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Source_ports[_Doom_-compatible] game engine
to be played: the link:download.html[download] page lists some
recommended programs.

_Freedoom_ is actually three entire games, with two single-player
campaigns and one collection of multiplayer deathmatch arenas (_FreeDM_).

== A compatible free replacement

There is a massive decades-long
https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Idgames_archive[back catalog] containing
thousands of _Doom_ levels and other mods made by fans of the
original game.  _Freedoom_ aims to be compatible with these and allows
most to be played without the need to use non-free software.  The
video to the right shows a _Doom_ mod running under _Freedoom_.

Just as https://www.gnu.org/[the GNU project] was started to develop a
free operating system to replace Unix, we aim to provide a free
replacement for _Doom_.  If you have artistic skills (visual, musical,
or maybe you just like making levels!) then you can
link:help.html[help us] achieve that aim by contributing to the
project!

== A collection of reusable artwork

_Freedoom_ contains hundreds of original textures, sound effects and
music tracks that can be reused royalty-free by _Doom_ level authors
and other independent game developers.

_Freedoom_ is liberally licensed under the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses[BSD license] - all that is
required is that you include a short copyright statement that credits
the _Freedoom_ project.

For some examples of projects that have used _Freedoom_'s assets, take a
look at the link:using.html[projects] page.
