= Other Projects Using Freedoom Assets
// See COPYING.adoc for license terms of this file.

Since link:about.html[_Freedoom_ is free], some other projects have
used _Freedoom_'s assets. We think this is a great use of the project
and should be encouraged. (Please be mindful of the https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/blob/master/COPYING.adoc[license], though.)

Here are an arbitrarily selected few that we know about. If you find any
others, please let us know by filing an issue or pull request on the
https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom.github.io[website project at GitHub].


== Applications

 * https://github.com/mkrupczak3/GZDoom-Android[Freedoom for Android] - a GZDoom Android port that comes pre-bundled with the singleplayer _Freedoom_ campaigns.

== Standalone Games

 * https://store.steampowered.com/app/3277520/Berserkers_Domain/[Berserker's Domain] - retro FPS Roguelike built in _Godot_ that uses _Freedoom_ textures and parts of level geometry.
 * https://github.com/Blasphemer[Blasphemer] - a project to do for _Heretic_ what _Freedoom_ does for _Doom_.
 * http://contest.gamedevfort.com/submission/657#.Ve8jwpcQlj0[Nocturne In Yellow] - a fantasy medieval first-person shooter where "you play as a dude marching through ancient castles with the realization that every myth and story ever made in the history of man is true and all of them are pissed off at you for having a pulse and four functional limbs."
 * https://filmsbykris.com/games/2021/cyber-griffin/website[Cyber Griffin] - a _Freedoom_-based sidescroller.
 * http://www.indiedb.com/games/terrorized[Terrorized] - a horror action RPG FPS.
 * https://mr795.itch.io/lost-in-hell[Lost In Hell] - a game that combines elements from _Freedoom_ and http://www.doomlegends.com/tpd/frames.html[_The People's Doom_].
 * http://www.indiedb.com/games/doominator-wave-survival[Doominator Wave Survival] - a wave-based survival FPS.
 * https://mobile.zame-dev.org/gloomy[Gloomy Dungeons] - a _very_ retro-style FPS, think like pre-_Doom_, pre-_Rise of the Triad_.

== Mods

 * https://zdoom.org/wiki/Barista[Barista] - a ZDoom mod ``inspired by the _Doom_ Bible, _Marathon_ and _Half-Life_. It uses resources derived from _Freedoom_ and various other sources, enough to replace everything needed by the single map and therefore work as a stand-alone.''
 * https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor[Hideous Destructor] - a GZDoom mod for both _Doom_ and _Freedoom_ that leans into the speculative fiction aspects of the monsters and weapons, with the side effect of turning the gameplay into a tactical simulation-style shooter with some parkour elements.
