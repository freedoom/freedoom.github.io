Help Freedoom!
==============

Freedoom is always looking for help. This is a short list of some of
the resources that the project is in need of. If you can help out,
please check the forum or IRC links in the sidebar to get in contact!

Artists
-------

**Flame bringer sprites**: Freedoom needs sprites for the ``flame
bringer'' monster. This is a monster encountered in Freedoom: Phase 2
which has the ability to raise other monsters from the dead and set
the player on fire. If you're an artist or 3D modeller you can help
out here.

**Pain Lord**: Freedoom has sprites for its Pain Lord monster, but
they are based on some incomplete concept sketches, and in need of
colorizing and cleaning up. Ideally, additional animation frames are
needed to fully develop the monster.

Musicians
---------

**In-level music**: Freedoom needs music for its levels. Presently
some of the music tracks are serving double duty for multiple levels.
FreeDM, the deathmatch spinoff project, also needs some appropriate
music for its levels.
For a current list of tracks that the project needs, see
http://freedoom.soulsphere.org/music-duplicates.shtml[here].

**OPL synth instruments**: If you like chiptunes, particularly for the
Yamaha OPL2/OPL3 synth chips, then Freedoom needs instruments for its
OPL MIDI instrument bank. Check out the
https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/tree/master/lumps/genmidi[documentation]
to find out more.

Level authors
-------------

**New levels**: Freedoom is still in need of new single player levels
in order to get a complete set of levels for Freedoom: Phase 1.
If you see a level that is just a square room with an exit
switch, that is a currently unfilled slot. If you are experienced
making Doom levels and can spend the time to make a level for
Freedoom, or maybe you have levels you've made and can donate to the
project, please get in touch.

**Bugs**: Sometimes bugs get reported in Freedoom's levels. Check out the
https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/labels/levels[bug list]
to see what currently needs fixing.

Bug reports
-----------

Freedoom is an ongoing project, and issues may always be found. The
preferred place, and the one that will not have reports lost in memory,
is the https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/issues[GitHub issue
tracker]. Information about all kinds of issues is much appreciated,
but if you find an issue in the latest release, don't be so quick to
report it! Check the http://freedoom.soulsphere.org/[latest and
greatest builds] to see if the problem still persists there: much of
Freedoom may have changed in the interim!
