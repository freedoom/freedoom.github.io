== Game data

_Freedoom_ is available in two versions, the first of which is a
single-player focused game, split in two parts, each of which is
compatible with different versions of the classic _Doom_ franchise
from id Software.  The second is a multiplayer-focused experience for
the popular ``deathmatch'' game mode.

https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases/download/v0.13.0/freedoom-0.13.0.zip[Freedoom: Phase 1+2]::

    _Phase 1_ is the first part of the single-player game, containing
    four episodes which are nine levels each, smoothly paced for
    beginner players.  It is compatible with mods for the original
    _Doom_ and _The Ultimate Doom_.

    _Phase 2_ is the second major part of the single-player game, a
    massive 32-level episode expanding upon the same concepts present
    in _Phase 1_, as well as containing additional monsters and the
    double-barreled shotgun!  The levels in this game tend to demand
    more skillful play than the previous episodes.  It is compatible
    with mods for _Doom II_.

https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases/download/v0.13.0/freedm-0.13.0.zip[FreeDM]::

    _FreeDM_ is a fast-paced competitive deathmatch game, part of the
    Freedoom project.  Rather than the usual single-player focused
    levels, these contain no monsters and are intended for deathmatch
    only.  It is compatible with mods for _Doom II_.

== Engine

_Freedoom_ requires the additional download of a game engine to
play. The following engines are recommended by the _Freedoom_ project:

[horizontal]
https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Crispy_Doom[Crispy Doom]::

    Crispy Doom preserves most of the original _Doom_ engine's classic
    look and feel while adding many quality-of-life modernizations.
    Its parent project, https://www.chocolate-doom.org/[Chocolate Doom],
    is much more faithful to the original DOS _Doom_ but is not recommended
    for ordinary use as it replicates some unstable behavior.

https://eternity.youfailit.net/wiki/Main_Page[Eternity Engine]::

    Eternity Engine is a feature-rich engine with a significant amount of
    customizability for more advanced level and gameplay modifications.

https://zdoom.org/[GZDoom]::

    GZDoom is an advanced _Doom_-engine-based general game development platform
    with enormous customizability for both authors and players. Many mods
    released for _Doom_ and _Freedoom_ have been developed around its unique
    features. It does, however, deviate significantly from the original Doom
    gameplay and aesthetics and cannot play any gameplay recordings (``demos'')
    that would otherwise work with the _Doom_ engine.

https://odamex.net/[Odamex]::

    Odamex is a fully-featured _Doom_ source port supporting both vanilla compatibility 
    and enhanced features. It has been designed to allow client/server-based Doom 
    gameplay over the Internet or LAN with advanced networking features, such as 
    packet compression, or unlagged. Odamex is also the only GNU GPL-licensed true 
    client/server port available. Odamex supports Freedoom out-of-the-box, allowing 
    both phases and FreeDM to be selected as games from the menu.

These engines, and https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port[many others],
are made possible thanks to the _Doom_ engine being released as
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free software] in 1997.

=== Android

The _Freedoom_ project does not officially support any engines nor
forks, though we would like to note for convenience that there is a
packaged version with GZDoom available for Android devices.  It is
available either on the
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nullsum.freedoom[Google
Play Store], or as an installable
https://github.com/mkrupczak3/Freedoom-for-Android/releases/latest[APK].

== Previous releases

Freedoom is an old project with many past releases, you may find some
of them on the https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases[GitHub
release page]. Unfortunately, many old releases have been officially
