<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Freedoom</em> is available in two versions, the first of which is a
single-player focused game, split in two parts, each of which is
compatible with different versions of the classic <em>Doom</em> franchise
from id Software.  The second is a multiplayer-focused experience for
the popular &#8220;deathmatch&#8221; game mode.</p></div>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">
    <em>Phase 1</em> is the first part of the single-player game, containing
    four episodes which are nine levels each, smoothly paced for
    beginner players.  It is compatible with mods for the original
    <em>Doom</em> and <em>The Ultimate Doom</em>.
   <br>
   <br>
    <em>Phase 2</em> is the second major part of the single-player game, a
    massive 32-level episode expanding upon the same concepts present
    in <em>Phase 1</em>, as well as containing additional monsters and the
    double-barreled shotgun!  The levels in this game tend to demand
    more skillful play than the previous episodes.  It is compatible
    with mods for <em>Doom II</em>.

    <em>FreeDM</em> is a fast-paced competitive deathmatch game, part of the

    levels, these contain no monsters and are intended for deathmatch
    only.  It is compatible with mods for <em>Doom II</em>.

    Crispy Doom preserves most of the original <em>Doom</em> engine's classic
    look and feel while adding many quality-of-life modernizations.
    Its parent project, <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/">Chocolate Doom</a>,
    is much more faithful to the original DOS <em>Doom</em> but is
    not recommended for ordinary use as it replicates some unstable behavior.

    GZDoom is an advanced <em>Doom</em>-engine-based general game development platform
    with enormous customizability for both authors and players. Many mods
    released for <em>Doom</em> and <em>Freedoom</em> have been developed around its unique
    features. It does, however, deviate significantly from the original Doom
    gameplay and aesthetics and cannot play any gameplay recordings (&#8220;demos&#8221;)
    that would otherwise work with the <em>Doom</em> engine.

<div class="paragraph"><p>These engines, and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port">many others</a>,
are made possible thanks to the <em>Doom</em> engine being released as
