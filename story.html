<h1>Before The Outbreak</h1>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>They called it Outpost Vincenzo, the smallest of three 
outposts in the ass-crack of Callisto. AGM funded the 
place as a pet project, and they ran it like a corporation 
runs anything: by cutting as many corners as possible. 
Your cell on earth was more fit for outer space, and 
the air was fresher, too. Every time someone flushed the 
toilet, the nuclear reactor hiccuped. Even the scenery 
sucked: a landscape of barren rock with a few pitiful
attempts at terraformed gardens, while Jupiter's ugly 
ass filled the sky and stared accusingly down at everyone 
like the eye of God. It was a failed attempt at terraforming
the moon's surface for colonization, demoted to an interstellar 
truckstop for passing starships.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It managed to do ONE thing right, though. It was impossible 
to escape from. The nearest dot of civilization was 
light-years away. The Geneva Convention was even further.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This was your assessment of the place your first hour as a 
visitor, after you had been registered, quarantined, and
scanned for space bedbugs. You were forced into a snug
new prison jumpsuit -- it doubled as a temporary space 
suit in emergencies -- and shoved up the hall to the 
commander's office. He looked like a gorilla with a crew 
cut and smiled like the Grim Reaper.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You knew you were in trouble when you glanced out 
the office window and saw your ship taking off without you.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"I'm Commander Philo," said the gorilla. "Your ship was 
called to make an emergency pickup, and they don't have 
room for you and the cargo, so they're leaving you in 
our care for a few weeks. Consider it an extended vacation. 
Compared to where you're going, Vincenzo is a resort."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>He looked over your file, occasionally glancing at you like 
a hangnail he was thinking about biting off. You thought 
about your destination: the Rock, the cosmic version of 
Alcatraz, where bad earthlings were sent to disappear forever.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"You're a disgrace to the human race," Philo finally said, 
dropping the file on the desktop as he walked around the 
desk to your side. "No wonder they kicked you off the planet."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"But I'm great with kids," you said.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The gorilla replied by jamming a cattle prod into your testicles
on full charge. When you stopped vomiting and your eyesight 
came back, he was hovering over you with that damn smile. 
"This is my world, my rules. You have nothing to say here."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Philo had you thrown into a closet with a fluorescent-lit 
cot and a glorified bedpan with plumbing. There you 
rotted for two weeks, with no company but the ever-staring 
eye of Jupiter overhead, and only the occasional beating 
or sleep deprivation experiment to occupy your time. 
Even in your dreams, Philo was a giant skull-faced monster
whose giant, bony hands brought only pain.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Starships came and went every hour. If it weren't for that, 
boredom would have driven you as batshit as the commander already.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The arrival of an AGM freighter caused a notable stir. The captain 
was a woman, her curves evident through her spacesuit even at a 
distance. She argued with two hangar grunts for ten minutes; then 
a spaceman with commander's stripes moonwalked out to her and 
argued for another fifteen. Eventually a guard came and escorted 
you to the rec room where Commander Philo was having coffee with 
the captain, her hair red and flowing like wine.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"You're the new tenant, yeah?" she said, offering her hand to you. 
She was Australian.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You didn't take the hand. "Who's askin'?"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Captain Dobkin. My impulse drive is cactus maximus, and we got an 
important delivery to make. The commander says you're shipping out 
to the Rock 'cuz of a hijacking."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"He says you're ace with fixing ships. You were an engineer on Earth, 
yeah?"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Out of the goddamned question," said Philo. "He's breaking the law 
just by LOOKING at a ship!"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>She ignored him. "All Philo's techies are green, and we have a deadline 
to keep."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You raised an eyebrow. "What's your cargo? Caviar?"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Six sleepy space monks." When she saw everyone's confused looks, she 
grinned. "That was my reaction, too. They're from that monastery on 
Titan, the one that went Defcon 1 awhile back. Picked up their distress 
signal on the way back from Pluto, HQ wanted 'em brought in ASAP."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"I thought nobody survived that disaster."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These guys did, but they're all veggies. We gotta keep 'em cold 
and keep 'em under 'til we get 'em home. The admins wanna poke 
around in their brains, find out what happened there. Power surge 
cacked the life support systems, and my guys won't go near those 
damn monks to check on 'em. It happens again, our cargo's liable 
to spoil. Or worse, wake up and try to convert us."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What do I get?"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Philo grabbed your collar and shook you violently. "Convicts don't 
bargain. They do as they're told."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dobkin looked at you as she stood up. "We've got important cargo 
'ere. IF you help us to ensure it gets delivered, AGM will return 
the favour, depending on what you want. That do?"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You peered up at the stars, then at the captain. "Alright, I'll 
do it."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The redheaded captain glanced at Philo."Get 'im a toolbelt," she 
said as she dropped her helmet and headed back out to the ship. 
"You make me late, Philo, it'll cost you YOUR job, too."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It was easy to see why the crew was so nervous once you met the 
cargo. The monks' cryotubes were lined up in the cargo bay like 
a six-pack of beer, secured in an upright position with bungee 
cords. All six were male, bald, pale, and had spooky aquiline 
features that made them resemble Roman statues. Their dead eyes 
stared blankly at the outside world.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You did a quick diagnostic check and found the surge protectors 
had been fried, along with one of the cryostasis tubes' control 
modules. You had just popped it apart to check the innards when 
you heard the dripping sound and glanced up.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Crimson ichor was oozing out of the cracks of the cryotube and 
slowly dribbling upward in noxious ropes as if gravity had been 
reversed, forming an ugly red puddle on the ceiling. You glanced 
back at the monk itself and found its dead eyes staring directly 
into you.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Something tried to claw its way into your mind, but you scrambled 
out of there before the visions got too vivid. After hearing your 
description of the scene, Philo took a dozen armed men into the cargo 
bay with the Captain and her first mate in tow. The ceiling was now a 
hellish crimson lake, and the statue-like monks were all looking 
directly at the commander. You could hear his mind snap like a twig.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Commander Philo opened his mouth to shriek the order to open fire just 
as the puddle spurted. The stream went straight down his throat.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You relished his screams at first, but once the alien chuttering started 
-- what sounded like laughter -- and the tentacles started ripping out of 
him, you were the first to bail. You don't remember much after that, except 
vague snippets of people being torn in half, guards with hideous yellow 
eyes turning their guns on their comrades, and the outpost twisting in its 
foundation as if reality itself were rejecting it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That was two days ago. You've kept quiet and hidden since then, listening 
to the former staff members chattering in alien gibberish on the radio; 
to the howls from the deepest reaches of your nightmares, echoing deeper 
within the outpost. All you had to do was sit tight until the next ship 
arrived, then get the hell outta dodge. You'd take the ship over if you had
to -- Philo had plenty of guns and ammo laying around the outpost. Or he 
DID, anyway, before the space-time continuum shit the bed and turned everyone
into mumbling space-boogeymen.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you relieved a dead starport guard of his pistol, the base intercom suddenly 
kicked on, and the screen in the nearby wall crackled to life. Grinning at you 
through the static was a nightmare caricature of the face you had grown to loathe.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"THERE you are, Dead Man," it rumbled. "Thought I'd forgotten about our playtime 
schedule, huh?"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You swallowed your bile. "Hey, Philo. Love the new makeover."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Good," the thing slobbered, "'cos you're next in line. Sit tight. I'm comin' 
to getcha."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The screen crackled and went black. Further up the hall, a door whined open, and through it came a chorus of alien babble, drawing closer with every word.</p></div>
