// See COPYING.adoc for license terms of this file.

// The naming convention for screenshot image files:
//   * <phase>-<engine-name>-<map>-<description>-<version>.png
//   * Each screenshot has a thumbnail with the same name, but prefixed with "th_".
//   * Lower case.
//   * Dash ("-") is preferred over underscore ("_").
//   * Spaces are not supported.

// Aspect ratio, dimensions and filtering
//   Traditional game engines, such as Chocolate Doom, produce 320x200
//   screenshots that were intended to rendered on a display with pixels that
//   are 1.2 times as tall as they are wide. However, since modern displays
//   have square pixels the screens shots look a bit distorted (they appear
//   shorter and wider than they should). To correct this the underlying
//   screenshot is scaled up 5x horizontally, and 6x vertically, which has a
//   ratio of 1.2, to produce a 1600x1200 pixel perfect representation of the
//   screenshot, but with 5x6 pixel blocks that have the required height. To do
//   this "-filter point" is passed to ImageMagick for Chocolate Doom only in
//   order to disable the interpolation than normally happens when images are
//   scaled. Alternatively the 320x200 screenshots can be scaled to 320x240 to
//   give them the correct aspect ratio. Doing so is pixel perfect in the 
//   horizontal direction only, which is what is done for the thumbnails.
//
//   Other game engines, such as GZDoom, assume square pixels, run at the full
//   system resolution (1920x1080 is common) and use OpenGL and related
//   technologies to interpolate between pixels. To accommodate this
//   "-filter point" is not used for the GZDoom screenshots - the usual image
//   scaling is allowed.
//
//   Timestamps (tIME chunks) are excluded from the thumbnails, but not the
//   full images, so that rebuilding the thumbails only causes a file
//   difference when the full image has changed. See the full image for the
//   time.

// The following Linux bash commands may be helpful.
//
// Append the version if it is not already appended:
//   v=0.13.0; for p in $(ls -1 img/screenshots/*.png | grep -v ^th_ | grep -vP '\d+\.\d+\.png'); do mv -i $p ${p/.png/-$v.png}; done
//
// Generate thumbnails with a height of 240:
//   rm -f img/screenshots/th_*.png; for p in $(ls -1 img/screenshots/*.png | grep -v ^th_); do if [[ $p == *chocolate* ]]; then opts="-filter point"; else opts=""; fi; convert $p -resize x240 -define png:exclude-chunk=tIME $opts img/screenshots/th_${p##*/}; done
//
// Output image links, which can be organized and placed below:
//   for t in img/screenshots/th_*.png; do p=${t/th_/}; echo "image:$t[link=\"$p\"]"; done

Since Freedoom is not a game engine multiple game engines are used here to
showcase it. The raw Chocolate Doom screenshots are 320x200. They have an
authentic 1990s FPS feel with crisp pixels. The raw GZDoom screenshots are
1920x1080. They excel at small background details at the cost of blurry
foreground details.
