// See COPYING.adoc for license terms of this file.

// The naming convention for screenshot image files:
//   * <phase>-<engine-name>-<map>-<description>-<version>.png
//   * Each screenshot has a thumbnail with the same name, but prefixed with "th_".
//   * Lower case.
//   * Dash ("-") is preferred over underscore ("_").
//   * Spaces are not supported.

// Aspect ratio, dimensions and filtering
//   Traditional game engines, such as Chocolate Doom, produce 320x200
//   screenshots that were intended to rendered on a display with pixels that
//   are 1.2 times as tall as they are wide. However, since modern displays
//   have square pixels the screens shots look a bit distorted (they appear
//   shorter and wider than they should). To correct this the underlying
//   screenshot is scaled up 5x horizontally, and 6x vertically, which has a
//   ratio of 1.2, to produce a 1600x1200 pixel perfect representation of the
//   screenshot, but with 5x6 pixel blocks that have the required height. To do
//   this "-filter point" is passed to ImageMagick for Chocolate Doom only in
//   order to disable the interpolation than normally happens when images are
//   scaled. Alternatively the 320x200 screenshots can be scaled to 320x240 to
//   give them the correct aspect ratio. Doing so is pixel perfect in the 
//   horizontal direction only, which is what is done for the thumbnails.
//
//   Other game engines, such as GZDoom, assume square pixels, run at the full
//   system resolution (1920x1080 is common) and use OpenGL and related
//   technologies to interpolate between pixels. To accommodate this
//   "-filter point" is not used for the GZDoom screenshots - the usual image
//   scaling is allowed.
//
//   Timestamps (tIME chunks) are excluded from the thumbnails, but not the
//   full images, so that rebuilding the thumbails only causes a file
//   difference when the full image has changed. See the full image for the
//   time.

// The following Linux bash commands may be helpful.
//
// Append the version if it is not already appended:
//   v=0.13.0; for p in $(ls -1 img/screenshots/*.png | grep -v ^th_ | grep -vP '\d+\.\d+\.png'); do mv -i $p ${p/.png/-$v.png}; done
//
// Generate thumbnails with a height of 240:
//   rm -f img/screenshots/th_*.png; for p in $(ls -1 img/screenshots/*.png | grep -v ^th_); do if [[ $p == *chocolate* ]]; then opts="-filter point"; else opts=""; fi; convert $p -resize x240 -define png:exclude-chunk=tIME $opts img/screenshots/th_${p##*/}; done
//
// Output image links, which can be organized and placed below:
//   for t in img/screenshots/th_*.png; do p=${t/th_/}; echo "image:$t[link=\"$p\"]"; done

Since Freedoom is not a game engine multiple game engines are used here
to showcase it. The https://www.chocolate-doom.org/[Chocolate Doom] screenshots
are based on 320x200 rendering output, scaled losslessly to 1600x1200 for an
authentic 1990s FPS feel with crisp pixels. The https://zdoom.org/[GZDoom]
screenshots are 1920x1080 with default pixel smoothing settings; they excel at small
background details at the cost of blurry foreground details.
